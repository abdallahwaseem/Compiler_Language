These are not issues , Just assumptions based on the language we choose ..

we made the statement can derive break , continue , ..
although these keywords must be used in the correct context so we will check later in phase 2 
----------------------------------

we removed boolean datatype in order to recursively make boolean expressions instead of only one 
since before we made recursive expressions on numbers

-----------------------------------


we dont allow boolean expressions in the middle of the code which will do nothing
ex: 
    int x=1;
    int y=2;
    x>y; --> this is meaningless so we didnt allow it 

    but we allowed it in the right context as if(x>y) , while(x>y) , f1(x>y) , ...


-----------------------------------
in switch cases 
we assumed each case is a new scope
case 1 :
    int x = 10; 
    break;
case 2 : 
    x = 5;  <------ error !
    break;

so here x is defined in case 1 only and cant use it in case 2 

-----------------------------------
MATHEMATICAL OPERATIONS !

the compiler doesnt allow 
x = true + true;

but it does allow it if its saved in an identifier like
bool y = true;
x = y + y;
