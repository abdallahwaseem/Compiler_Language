These are not issues , Just assumptions based on the language we choose ..

we made the statement can derive break , continue , ..
although these keywords must be used in the correct context so we will check later in phase 2 
----------------------------------

we removed boolean datatype in order to recursively make boolean expressions instead of only one 
since before we made recursive expressions on numbers

-----------------------------------


we dont allow boolean expressions in the middle of the code which will do nothing
ex: 
    int x=1;
    int y=2;
    x>y; --> this is meaningless so we didnt allow it 

    but we allowed it in the right context as if(x>y) , while(x>y) , f1(x>y) , ...
